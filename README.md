# Instructions
These dotfiles are managed using Dotbot.
If you found these, I wouldn't recommend cloning and installing, but feel to look for something interesting (though there are plenty of other better examples out there).
One new thing I found recently is nano customizations (submodule included)!
I don't spend a lot of time in nano, but it's nice for it to look decent when I use it for quick edit.
